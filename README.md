Here is a project I am working on to explore if there are any patterns or relationships between the size of PÅ«keko (Porphyrio melanotus melanotus) eggs (i.e. length and width), the order of laying and hathing, and the size of chicks at hatching. I have the data of egg size, length from the end of the shield to the tip of the beak, and length of the left outer tarsus measured in mm using digital calipers. I also have the mass of the chicks at hatching using a spring scale. The laying order is only known when addtional eggs were found in the nest during monitoring, and the hatching order is only known when there were not synchronous hatching of multiple chicks at the same time. Sometimes we can tell which chick came from which egg and the hatching order and the data most of my analyses will be using.
